        A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administrator’s
        rules regarding user behavior and provides information about the
        actions the website administrator can and will perform. Essentially,
        your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and
        its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at
        it to determine whether each party acted within their rights. Creating
        the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business
        from the following:
